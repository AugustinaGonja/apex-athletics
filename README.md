## Design

### Colour Scheme 
I used the website ["Coolors"](https://coolors.co/) to select my color scheme.

A selection of natural tones, featuring **various shades of blue.**  
To bring energy and vibrancy to the site, **yellows, oranges, and whites** are included.
This will capture the core themes of **speed, athleticism, and power** while maintaining a balanced and harmonious feel.

### Typography
All fonts on this website are imported from "Google Fonts". To enhance its sporty,sleek and impactful design, the primary font is **"Oswald".** which offers a range of font weights. As a fallback, **Montserrat** is used to maintain a modern, clean aesthetic while ensuring readability. If neither font loads, a generic **sans-serif** will be applied. 

**CSS Code --> font-family: "Oswald" ,Montserrat, sans-serif;**

### Imagery
The site's imagery will feature track athletes running, jumping, and throwing, highlighting individuals of various ages and abilites.

*All images will be linked to their original source in the credits section.*

### Wireframes
Wireframes below created using "Balsamiq".
Each page has its own wireframe as displayed on different screen sizes.

## Features 
My website is fully responsive across all screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and functionality on devices ranging from mobile phones to desktops.

The website consists of three pages: the Home Page, the Training & Schedules Page, and the Contact Page.

**Favicon:**

![Image showing Favicon](assets/favicon_io/android-chrome-512x512.png)


**Navigation Bar:**

It features a functional navigation bar.

On desktop devices, the full menu is visible, allowing users to easily click and interact with the menu items.

![Image showing Navbar on Desktop](assets/images/Header.png)

On phones and tablets, the menu is replaced by a burger icon. When clicked, it expands to display the menu items stacked vertically for better accessibility on smaller screens.

**Footer:**
![Image showing Footer](assets/images/footer.png)
The footer remains consistent across all screen sizes, with its contents adjusting in size to fit the full width of the browser.

**Home Page:**

The homepage features a carousel showcasing images of club members. Users can navigate through the slideshow using side toggles, although it progresses automatically. Following this, an "About Us" section highlights the club's goals and facilities. The subsequent section elaborates on the club's offerings, using a combination of icons and text to effectively convey information to users.

**Training Schedule Page:**

The training schedule page welcomes users with a hero image. The first section outlines the timetable, featuring several tables that correspond to each day of the week and list all available training sessions. Multiple "Register" buttons are included, redirecting users to the contact page with a sign-up form. Following this, the "Upcoming Events" section presents information through cards, each containing an image and a brief description.

**Contact Page:**

The contact page features a matching hero image. It includes a registration form where users must enter their information, with validation requiring a name, email, and phone number. The page concludes with general contact details, including the club's address, phone number, and email.

### Future Implementation:**

If I were to return to this project I would like to :

* Create a more dynamic first page with a few additional engaging sections.
* Add a testimonials section featuring feedback from participants of various classes.
* Include a mailing list sign-up option, allowing users to receive updates about events or classes without extra effort.
* Enable users to create their own accounts, making event and class sign-ups quicker by saving their information.
* Improve the interactivity and readability of the tables on the second page.
* Enhance accessibility across all pages, considering features like color-blind-friendly designs.

I believe these improvements would fully enhance the overall user experience of my website.

# Credits & Code Used
* I drew significant inspiration from the [Love Running - Essentials Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LRFX101+6/courseware/e805068059af42af87681032aa64053f/1da6ad13213740f1855a51d30a2375b1/). This example was particularly helpful as the Love Running website addresses a similar fitness and sports theme to my own.The walkthrough provided essential guidance, especially in helping me develop a responsive navigation bar and very basic page structure including the footer.

* I frequently used [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) to find solutions to specific coding questions and explore discussions around similar issues I encountered while writing my code. Additionally, I referred to [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) for more general queries and foundational information.

* YouTube was also a valuable resource. I specifically used this [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVjAA6UxvtU&t=318s) to learn how to style images within the carousel and position them effectively. Another [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNcJuPIZ2WE) helped me understand form handling and the process that occurs after submission.

* [Favicon Generator used to produce Favicon image](https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/)

* [FontAwesome] https://fontawesome.com/
# Content
All written content, including the text on tables and cards, was composed by me. I used Grammarly as an assistant to enhance the flow and readability of the text.
