All fonts on this website are imported from "Google Fonts". To enhance its sporty,sleek and impactful design, the primary font is **"Oswald".** which offers a range of font weights. As a fallback, **Montserrat** is used to maintain a modern, clean aesthetic while ensuring readability. If neither font loads, a generic **sans-serif** will be applied.
